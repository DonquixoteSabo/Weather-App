## Overview

![screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/rgplGxz.png)

- Making this project was really funny for me. I tried to do this project 2 months ago but it was too difficult for me. After mastered some usefull skills, this challenge was possible for me. I am very proud of this effect.
- I learnt a lot. I know how to use more advanced styled-components and redux-thunk. Before this project, it was impossible for me to perform asynchronous actions in Redux, but now I know how to do it.. I also learnt a little bit more about atomic design in react applications.
